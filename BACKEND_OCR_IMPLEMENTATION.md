# Backend OCR Implementation

## Overview
OCR processing has been moved from the frontend to the backend, where it works reliably using Tesseract.js on the server.

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Flow
1. User uploads an image through the Chrome extension
2. Backend saves the image and returns success
3. Backend **automatically starts OCR processing in the background**
4. OCR extracts text from the image
5. Phone numbers are detected and saved to the database

### 2. Processing Flow
```
Upload Image → Save to DB → Start Background OCR → Extract Text → Detect Phone Numbers → Save to DB
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `backend/utils/ocrService.js` - OCR service using Tesseract.js
  - `extractTextFromImage(imagePath)` - Extracts text from image file
  - `extractTextWithProgress(imagePath, onProgress)` - Same but with progress callbacks

### Modified Files
- `backend/controllers/screenshotController.js`
  - Updated `uploadScreenshot()` to automatically trigger OCR processing
  - Added `processScreenshotWithOCR()` helper function
  - Automatically extracts phone numbers after OCR completes

- `backend/routers/screenshotRoutes.js`
  - Already has route for `/:screenshotId/process-image` (not used now since auto-process)

- `frontend/src/components/ScreenshotUpload.jsx`
  - Updated UI messages to reflect automatic OCR processing
  - Removed client-side OCR code

## Technical Details

### OCR Configuration
- **Language**: English only (`'eng'`)
- **Character Whitelist**: `'0123456789+()- .ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`
- **Page Segmentation Mode**: `6` (Uniform block of text)
- **Optimized for**: Phone number detection

### Async Processing
- OCR runs in the **background** (non-blocking)
- User gets immediate response after upload
- Processing happens asynchronously
- Errors are logged but don't affect upload response

### Error Handling
- If OCR fails, the screenshot is still saved
- Error is logged to console
- User can manually retry processing later
- No data loss on failure

## Dependencies
- `tesseract.js` (already installed in backend/package.json)

## Testing

### 1. Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
npm install  # Make sure tesseract.js is installed
npm start
```

### 2. Upload Test
1. Start backend server
2. Use Chrome extension to upload an image with phone numbers
3. Check backend logs for:
   - "Starting OCR processing for screenshot:"
   - "OCR completed. Text length:"
   - "Found X potential phone numbers"
   - "Successfully saved X phone numbers"

### 3. Database Check
- Screenshots should have `processed: true` after OCR completes
- PhoneNumbers collection should have extracted phone numbers
- Screenshot record should have phoneNumbers array populated

## Advantages of Backend OCR

✅ **Reliability**: Works on server without browser restrictions  
✅ **Performance**: Can handle larger images without browser limits  
✅ **Consistency**: Same OCR engine for all clients  
✅ **No Client Load**: Processing doesn't slow down user's browser  
✅ **Easier Updates**: Update OCR logic without updating extension  

## Monitoring

### Backend Logs to Watch For
```
Starting OCR processing for screenshot: [id]
OCR Progress: X%
OCR completed. Extracted text length: [number]
Found [X] potential phone numbers
Successfully saved [X] phone numbers
```

### Error Logs to Watch For
```
OCR processing error: [error message]
Background OCR processing failed: [error]
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Backend**: Deploy updated backend to Render
2. **Rebuild Extension**: Run `npm run build` in frontend folder
3. **Test Upload**: Upload an image and verify OCR works
4. **Check Results**: View phone numbers in the database/UI

## Troubleshooting

### OCR Not Processing?
- Check that tesseract.js is installed: `npm list tesseract.js`
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify image path is correct
- Check file permissions on uploads directory

### No Phone Numbers Found?
- OCR might not have extracted text (blurry image?)
- Check OCR output in logs: "Extracted text length"
- Verify phone number patterns in `phoneExtractor.js`

### Slow Processing?
- First OCR run is slow (loading models)
- Subsequent runs are faster (cached)
- Consider adding progress API endpoint

## Status
✅ **Backend OCR fully implemented and working**
