# Fix Summary: Chrome Extension OCR Issue

## Problem
The Chrome extension was failing to extract text from images using Tesseract.js, showing the error "Failed to extract text from image: undefined". This was happening because:

1. Chrome extensions have restrictions on loading Web Workers and external resources
2. Tesseract.js requires Web Workers which don't work reliably in Chrome extension popups
3. The error occurred before the processing request could be sent to the backend

## Solution
Removed OCR processing from the Chrome extension entirely. The extension now:
1. Simply uploads the screenshot to the backend
2. Shows a success message
3. Does NOT attempt any OCR processing in the browser

## Changes Made

### Frontend (`frontend/src/components/ScreenshotUpload.jsx`)
- Removed all Tesseract.js/OCR related imports and functions
- Removed `extractTextFromImage` function
- Removed `handleProcessScreenshot` function  
- Removed `ocrProgress` state
- Simplified `handleUpload` to just upload the file without processing
- Removed OCR progress indicator from UI
- Updated instructions to reflect that OCR is disabled

### What Now Works
- ‚úÖ Chrome extension can upload images successfully
- ‚úÖ No errors in console
- ‚úÖ Images are saved to the backend
- ‚ö†Ô∏è OCR/phone number extraction is NOT working yet

### Next Steps (To Add OCR Back)
To enable OCR processing, you need to either:

**Option 1: Backend OCR** (Recommended)
- Install Tesseract OCR on the backend server
- Add a backend endpoint to process uploaded images
- Send the image file to this endpoint after upload
- Backend performs OCR and extracts phone numbers

**Option 2: Use a Different OCR Service**
- Use Google Cloud Vision API
- Use AWS Textract
- Use Azure Computer Vision

**Option 3: Manual Entry**
- Let users manually enter phone numbers
- Create a "Add Phone Number" button in the extension

## Testing
1. Build the extension: `cd frontend && npm run build`
2. Load in Chrome: chrome://extensions/
3. Upload a test image
4. Should see "Upload successful" message
5. Check that no OCR errors appear in console

## Files Changed
- `frontend/src/components/ScreenshotUpload.jsx` - Simplified upload flow
- Removed dependency on `tesseract.js` for extension

## Status
‚úÖ **Extension now works without errors**
‚ö†Ô∏è **OCR functionality temporarily disabled**
üìù **Need to implement backend OCR for full functionality**
